# Astromoony

A simple font that encodes astronomical symbols, both official and unofficial.

Most notably, symbols for major moons are implemented as ligatures.
For example, "♂I" renders as a single symbol for Phobos (Mars I), 
and "♄VI" renders as a single symbol for Titan (Saturn VI)

The characters
The serif version uses is a modification of the Public Domain [Quivira font](http://quivira-font.com/)
