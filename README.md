# Astromoony Font

A simple font that encodes astronomical symbols, both official and unofficial.

Most notably, symbols for major moons are implemented as ligatures.
For example, "♂I" renders as a single symbol for Phobos (Mars I), 
and "♄VI" renders as a single symbol for Titan (Saturn VI)

[The characters can be previewed at this webpage](https://www.rmwinslow.com/posts/nature/astrofont.html).

### Glyphs

The sans-serif glyphs are all made by me, 
though I have attempted to make them stylistically similar to the characters in Alexander Lange's [Catrinity font](https://catrinity-font.de/index.html).


The serif version uses modified glyphs of Alexander Lange's Public Domain [Quivira font](http://quivira-font.com/).



## Glyph Designs

The designs for the Sun, Earth's Moon, Major Planets, Pluto, Ceres, and Asteroids are all fairly old and in wide use.

The symbols for the other moons and dwarf planets are [modern designs by Denis Moskowitz](https://suberic.net/~dmm/astro/),
though I have substantially modified the designs for Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Kerberos, and Orcus.
